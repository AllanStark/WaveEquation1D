# Multi-DOF-SprinMassDamperModel
Models a multiple DOF spring mass damper system in terms of state space matrices A,B,C,D.

nDOF_Spring_Damper_Mass_SIxOsystem. function models a multiple DOF spring mass damper system and represents the system in terms of state space matrices A,B,C,D. This representation gives a better insight into the inner system behaviour. General system properties, for example, the system controllability or observability can be defined and determined very easily.
Please refer to the following link for more detail about the intricacies of the model. The reader is Specifically directed to page no. 9 of the following lecture.
